Aspiring Full-Stack Developer
-----------------------------

For many years, I held various jobs, but never felt a sense of purpose. That all changed when I discovered web development. Problem solving and learning new things excited me, and I knew this was the perfect match for my interests. I started my journey by taking a five day coding challenge at a bootcamp. After the challenge was completed, I enrolled in a frontend development bootcamp at Bath Spa University which I'm currently doing. My course covers HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and is giving me a thorough understanding of the basics of web development. The best part of web development is that it’s an ever-evolving field. New trends and technologies are constantly being introduced, and staying up-to-date is essential. I’m taking advantage of this by reading books, blogs, and watching tutorials to ensure I’m making the most out of my skills and staying up to date with the industry. Web development has become a huge passion for me, and I’m so glad I’ve found something that I can pour so much of my energy into. I’m constantly looking for ways to challenge myself and become the best developer I can be. With my newfound knowledge and enthusiasm, I’m sure I’ll have no problem achieving this goal.

* ⚡  The best advice I ever received was, Push harder. Do better. Don't let complacency become the norm. Be bold and seek out new experiences and knowledge. Don't be afraid to take risks and make decisions; don't be afraid to fail. Have an open mind and be willing to learn from your mistakes. Show your determination and ambition in all that you do. Have a willingness to go beyond your comfort zone and be willing to make the hard choices. Believe in yourself and your abilities and strive to achieve greatness. Never give into doubt or fear, be brave and determined. Push yourself to reach your goals and never give up. Be relentless in your pursuit of success and always strive for excellence. Keep your focus and never lose sight of your ambitions. Push yourself to take on difficult tasks and never settle for mediocrity. Do the best you can in all that you do and be proud of your achievements. Do what you must do to reach your goals and never give into complacency. Push harder, do better, and never give in.
